# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. **Repository name**: `viber-missed-call-scheduler`
3. **Description**: `📞 Automated system for scheduling Viber missed call reminders in Google Calendar with smart 6 PM scheduling`
4. **Visibility**: ✅ Public
5. **Initialize**: ❌ Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we have them)
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Instead, run these:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/viber-missed-call-scheduler.git

# Ensure we're on main branch
git branch -M main

# Push everything to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
- Check your repository on GitHub
- Verify all files are there (should be 15 files)
- Confirm no sensitive data was uploaded

## 📋 Repository Details

**What will be uploaded:**
- ✅ All source code (5 Python files)
- ✅ Complete documentation (5 MD files) 
- ✅ GitHub templates (2 issue templates)
- ✅ Project configuration (requirements.txt, .gitignore)
- ✅ Examples and startup scripts

**What stays private:**
- 🔒 credentials.json (your Google API keys)
- 🔒 token.json (OAuth tokens)
- 🔒 *.log files (system logs)
- 🔒 viber_missed_calls.json (your call history)
- 🔒 Your actual missed calls file

## 🎯 Expected Result

Your repository will have:
```
📁 viber-missed-call-scheduler
├── 📚 Professional documentation
├── 🤖 Complete working code
├── 🔒 Zero sensitive data
├── 🐛 GitHub issue templates
└── ⭐ Ready for stars and contributions!
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**If push fails:**
```bash
# If remote already exists
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/viber-missed-call-scheduler.git

# If branch issues
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main --force
```

**If authentication issues:**
- Use GitHub Desktop app
- Or use personal access token instead of password
